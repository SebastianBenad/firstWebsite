            <p>I am a self taught web developer & love to freelance. I learned by reading the documentation (manuals) & a variety of online courses or tutorials. I have several certifications which I can share if requested but, if you're hiring a programmer
                don't look for certifications. Look at their work!</p>

            <p>If you're the owner of a brand new business & a little tech savy, I recommend searching "wordpress website tutorial" on youtube and copying the first website you like. This saves you $$$ and gets you a website that LOOKS professional. Alternatively
                most web hosts like goDaddy offer free website builders.</p>

            <h3 class="jobSubHeading">Why hire a Developer?</h3>
            <p>A website built from scratch & tailored to your needs will have advantages. The most notable are better SEO, faster load speeds & greater freedom when it comes to design. SEO or search engine optimization is a large subject and there are entire
                teams of people one can hire to get on the front page of google. I don't offer active SEO however, a fast website with proper code goes a long way ;).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="jobCard">
            <h3 class="jobSubHeading">Not sure now?</h3>
            <p>If you're the type of person who wants things done right from the get go & don't mind spending some money to get it done, give me or another developer a shout. ***BUT*** If you plan to frequently edit the site, have a tight budget, or want
                to become a blogger. Learn wordpress yourself!!! It is not worth it to hire a developer for every little change and if you serve content it's best to know your platform.</p>
