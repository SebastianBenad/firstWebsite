            <p>I am a self taught free lance web developer. No degree? I learned by reading the documentation (manuals) which are available online ;). I have several certifications but if you're hiring a programmer don't look at that piece of paper. Look
                at their work!</p>

            <h3 class="jobSubHeading">WAIT!!!</h3>
            <p>If you're the owner of a brand new business & a little tech savy, I recommend searching "wordpress website tutorial" on youtube and copying the first website you like. This saves you $$$ and gets you a website that LOOKS professional. Alternatively
                most web hosts like goDaddy offer free website builders.</p>

            <h3 class="jobSubHeading">Why hire a Developer?</h3>
            <p>A website built from scratch & tailored to your needs will have advantages. The most notable ones are better SEO & load speeds which can offer a competitive edge over the people who are still using website builders. If no one in your business
                sector has a professional website, having one will likely get you higher up on google. If people have hired SEO companies even a website built from scratch won't get higher up ***BUT*** if you choose to hire someone for SEO with a website
                that is coded from scratch, they will love you!</p>

        <div class="jobCard">
            <h3 class="jobSubHeading">Not sure now?</h3>
            <p>If you're the type of person who wants things done right from the get go, get a website that's coded from scratch. ***BUT*** If you plan to frequently edit the site, have a tight budget, or want to become a blogger. Learn wordpress yourself!!!
                If it is a beginner site it is not worth it to hire a developer for every little change. If you're a blogger learning it will save you $$$ in developer costs.</p>
